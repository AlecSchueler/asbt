DESCRIPTION
------------

From the manpage:

asbt (Alec Schueler's Bug Tracker) is a small python script for managing issues
on a local project. When called with no arguments, an issue is read from stdin
and saved to the file ./asbt. Alternatively, the issue is taken to be any left
over arguments (i.e., those arguments which are not options or the explicit
arguments to particular options).  The ./asbt file is intended to be
human-readable and editable, and is consists of space delimited fields in the
order "issue number, urgency, state (open/closed), type
(bug/enhancement/proposal), description." Any literal spaces in the description
field will be ignored.


INSTALLATION
------------

See "INSTALL."
